## Setup

Be aware that Blend Modes are not included with the project and an error will be loged after opening the project for the first time.

First, Import Blend Modes from the Asset Store. Then open the `Assets/Scenes/Scample` scene, select an object with a blend mode effect component (eg, `Sprites/RGB`) and click "Install Shader Extension". Now you can run the sample scene.
